GanderPrototyping
======

User testing prototypes for Gander, a secure, mobile-friendly way to access and search Microsoft Exchange email. 

\nIncluded in this repo are 5 prototypes. A and B model the onboard sign up/log in process, and C, D, and E model the inbox message list. 

Description
------------
Each user test is contained within a separate folder at the root level and contains an `index.html` 
file that serves as its root. Access the 5 prototypes at:
* A: [www.ripariandata.github.com/Gander/index/A](www.ripariandata.github.com/Gander/index/A)
* B: [www.ripariandata.github.com/Gander/index/A](www.ripariandata.github.com/Gander/index/A)

For example, the start page for test A can be found at `/A/index.html` and
it can be accessed at [ripariandata.github.com/Gander/index/A](ripariandata.github.com/Gander/index/A)

Unlike most repositories on GitHub, the default branch is not master; it is gh-pages. 
Any changes pushed to GitHub will automatically be available at [ripariandata.github.com/Gander](ripariandata.github.com/Gander)

The user tests are static web pages that use Javascript for dynamic content. 
Shared images, scripts, and stylesheets are contianed in `/images`, `/scripts`, and `/css`, respectively.

Running a test Locally on your Computer
---------------------------------------
Just open one of the index.html files in a browser like Chrome or Safari.
